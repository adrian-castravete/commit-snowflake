Commit Snowflake
================

The idea behind the project is to generate a snowflake based on a given
hexadecimal input, such as a *Git Commit Number*.

Usage
-----

The standard interface gives you the **canvas** and knows how to build
the snowflake from the *hash* location.

Future
------

The intention is to also create a **chrome/chromium** extension activateable on
*github* or *bitbucket*.
